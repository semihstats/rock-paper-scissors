# rock paper scissors
This program allows the user to play the popular game "Rock, Paper, Scissors" against a computer opponent. The rules of the game are as follows:

Rock beats scissors
Scissors beats paper
Paper beats rock
The user can choose how many rounds they want to play, and for each round, they are prompted to enter their choice of rock, paper or scissors. The computer then randomly selects its choice, and the winner of the round is determined based on the rules above.

At the end of the game, the program displays the final score and declares the winner.

How to Use

Note: If you enter an invalid input (i.e. anything other than rock, paper or scissors), the program will prompt you to enter your choice again.
